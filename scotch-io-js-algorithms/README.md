# The Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Algorithms

This course is designed to help you write better Javascript in order to be able to optimize data handling and processing wherever Javascript can run.

First we gain sufficient understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures as well as consider associated terms and the practicality of such knowledge. Next we dive into implementing various algorithms and Data structures common to more conventional languages like C++ and Java. In each case, we examine various possible implementations, determine the most optimal and identify real-world usages of each solution considered.
